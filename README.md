# Todo List Web App

This is a simple and lightweight Todo List application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows you to add tasks with an optional due date, display them in a clean list, and delete them when no longer needed.  
The project focuses on core web development skills without using any external libraries or frameworks.
